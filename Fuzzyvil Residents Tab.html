<p>Hi! My name is Dotty. I'm definitely the most popular bunny in Fuzzyvil. My birthday is March 14th. I'm really good at home repair and my life goal is to be a tennis player. My favorite song is K.K. Technopop and I always wear my Blue Check Shirt. I'm really into modern style and all that other cool stuff. "It's always a good hare day."</p>

<p>Hey, I'm Marcel. I guess you could say I'm a pretty lazy dog, but whatever. I'm really good at eating frequently, but I want to be an artist. All my stuff is pretty iconic, if I do say so myself. I used to always wear my Chichi Print Tee, but I've grown to like wearing Hero's Clothes, just like Mayor Oswald. My birthday is December 31st. My favorite song is Comrade K.K. "There's not a dog so bad he won't wag his tail."</p>

I really want to be an Esthetician, which is a person who is knowledgeable about the nature and appreciation of beauty, especially in art(according to the dictionary). My birthday is November 9th, and my favorite song is K.K. Casbah. "A thing of beauty is a joy forever!"</p>
